                                    <p>Midrub Wmarketing is an app for <a href="https://codecanyon.net/item/midrub-schedule-and-publish-on-the-most-popular-social-networks/17447773" target="_blank">Midrub</a>. You can't use it without <a href="https://codecanyon.net/item/midrub-schedule-and-publish-on-the-most-popular-social-networks/17447773" target="_blank">Midrub</a>.</p>
                                    <p>Midrub Wmarketing is an app for Midrub which allows to send promotional messages to your Whatsapp contacts. This app can't be used for spam and you can't use it to import contacts.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>How the Midrub Wmarketing&nbsp; app really works?</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>First of all you need the Midrub Wchatbot app.</li>
                                        <li>Once you have it, you have to configure it to auto-reply to the received messages.</li>
                                        <li>Every time when&nbsp; Midrub Wchatbot will reply to a message with a Quick Reply, will save te contact as subscriber with the Quick Replies categories.</li>
                                        <li>For example a Quick Reply has the Category 1 and Category 2. Every user which will get the Quick Reply, will receive automatically the categories Category 1 and Category 2. </li>
                                        <li>After this you can use the Midrub Wmarketing app to create a Promotional Message and select the category Category 1 or Category 2 to send the promotional message to all subscribers which have the category.</li>
                                        <li>The Midrub Wmarketing app will show you how many subscribers have the selected categories.</li>
                                        <li>Once saved, the promotional message will show you how many subscribers have received it and who haven't received it. You will see in the list the subscribers in the Promotional Message page.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        <br>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The Midrub Wmarketing&nbsp; has even the automatizations. How the automatimations works? First of all you have to create an automatization and select the time when the automatization message will be sent. You have to select the categories(for example Category 1). After this, every time when the Midrub Wchatbot app will save a subscriber with the category Category 1, will be sent the promotional message to the saved subscriber.</p>
                                    <p>Each automatization shows you how many subscribers have received it. You can see the subscribers list. Also, it shows the sent messages number per day in the last 30 days. Anytime you can edit the automatization.</p>
                                    <p>In the Audit Logs page you can see the most popular automatizations in the last 30 days. You can filter them by Whatsapp number. Also, the Audit Logs page shows the total number of automatized messages send per day in the last 30 days.</p>
                                    <p>The Midrub Wmarketing is a Midrub app and it can be enabled per plan and used as SAAS. Team owners can restrict it's access per team's role.</p>
                                    <p>The Midrub Wmarketing&nbsp; like the Midrub Wchatbot app is based on Twilio and your clients should have a Twilio account.</p>

                                    <h2>About Midrub Wmarketing's Code</h2>
                                    <p>The&nbsp;Midrub Wmarketing app has a code adapted for the Midrub CMS and it follows all parameters required
                                        for a Midrub app. It has support for Midrub's api, cron jobs, ajax requests, hooks, teams, etc.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>You can translate this app in several languages and all languages directories are located in the language
                                        directory. If you want to translate it, please follow the documentation&nbsp;<a
                                            href="https://www.midrub.com/categories/translation"
                                            target="_blank">https://www.midrub.com/categories/translation</a>
                                        <a href="https://www.midrub.com/categories/translation" target="_blank"></a>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The hooks located in the directory inc allows you to configure this app in the admin panel, restrict per plan and
                                        restrict per team. You can add there even other kind of files. </p>
                                    <p>In the controllers directory you will see 3 files: user, ajax and bot. User is to display the html content to
                                        users. Ajax is to process the Ajax Requests. Bot replies to messages in messenger.</p>
                                    <p>In the directory helpers you will find all files created to manage better the code and process only required
                                        data. The helpers are based on the controllers directory's files.</p>
                                    <p>In the models directory you will find the app's models which creates the required tables in the database. I like
                                        now to use more the Midrub's Base Model for simply SQL queries but for more complex queries i'm using the app's
                                        model.</p>
                                    <p>The directory views contains the views files loaded from from the User's controller.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>In this app i've used a new library with font icons which you can find here&nbsp;<a
                                            href="https://lineicons.com/icons/" target="_blank">https://lineicons.com/icons/</a>&nbsp;This library isn't
                                        loaded from app, it is available in the Midrub User's Theme, Luna. I'm providing the theme together with the
                                        Midrub Wmarketing app. If you still want to use the Blue Theme, just add in the header from admin the link
                                        to icons.</p>

                                    <p>If you don't want the Luna theme, you have to add the LineIcons links in Midrub -&gt; Admin -&gt; User -&gt; User Settings -&gt; Header Code.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>To send automatic promotional messages with&nbsp;Midrub Wmarketing:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>You need Quick Replies in the Midrub Wchatbot app.</li>
                                        <li>If you have created Quick Replies in the Midrub Wchatbot app, select one or more categories.</li>
                                        <li>Connect Whatsapp numbers.</li>
                                        <li>Select one or more categories for each connected number.</li>
                                        <li>Now, go to the Midrub Wmarketing app and create an automatization.</li>
                                        <li>Enter the title.&nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Select the time when the message will be sent calculating from the time when subscriber will receive the Quick Reply.</li>
                                        <li>Select one or more categories which are selected in the Quick Replies which meets the promotional message which you're creating now.</li>

                                    <p>After this, every time when you will have a new subscriber, the Midrub Wmarketing will look to verify if there is available an automatization with the subscriber's category and will send a promotional message.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <h2>Schedule messages to be sent to your Whatsapp clients</h2>
                                    <p>The&nbsp;Midrub Wmarketing app allows you to send both automatic and manual promotional messages. The difference is the automatic messages are sent automatically every day to your new subscribers. The manual messages are sent when you're deciding. For example you can start a campaign and every user which will message you a campaign word will be saved in a list with the campaign category. Then you will select the category and will send for example a discount coupon code as message.</p>
                                    <p>To send manual messages:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Go to the&nbsp;Midrub Wmarketing app.</li>
                                        <li>Click on the Promotional Messages menu item.</li>
                                        <li>Click on the button New message.</li>
                                        <li>Enter a message title displayed only to you.</li>
                                        <li>Select the scheduling time.</li>
                                        <li>Select a category and you will see how many subscribers have the category.</li>
                                        <li>Enter the message.</li>
                                        <li>Click on the Save button.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The saved message will be sent when you have scheduled it. In the message page you will see:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Scheduling time.</li>
                                        <li>Message content.</li>
                                        <li>Selected subscribers.</li>
                                        <li>Subscribers list with error or success message.</li>
                                        <li>Selected categories.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The promotional messages can't be edited.</p>
                                    <p>This is a legal solution. I'm going to develop in the next 2 months two very useful and original apps which your clients will like and after i will create same Whatsapp apps based on a different way.</p>

                                    <p>Each subscriber will have one or more categories, anytime you can select/unselect the subscriber's categories from the&nbsp;Subscribers page. This can be useful to remove users or include in the category which will be selected for a Promotional Message.</p>
                                    <p>The Subscribers page contains:</p>
                                    <ul>
